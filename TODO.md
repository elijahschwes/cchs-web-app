# A list of things to do.

> Lunch menu implementation. (How? Run a task that downloads the lunch menu at the end of every month, and then appropriately use the next month to get the lunch menu. After this, we can analyze that all of the lunch menus use the same template. We can choose a starting point (which could be the first date on the calender) and we can check if school is even opened that day (for lunch) if the color of said pixel is a certain color, if is a day of school we can open the div for that section and read the text which is the lunch menu. )

> Calender system implementation. (almost exactly the same as above)

> Sport announcing implementation.

> Push Notification System for games, if possible show scores of the team.
