# A list of things to do.

> Lunch menu implementation. (Instead of previous idea, send a GET request to [lunch menus endpoint](https://www.clsd.k12.pa.us/cornwall-lebanon-school-district/departments/food-services/lunch-breakfast-menus/) and then query the html with jsdom for 'a' elements that contain the text that ends in "-Menu.pdf" and this should give the updated menus for all three possible supported lunch menu options.)

> Calender system implementation. (instead of previous implementation just send a get request to the online calendar, but then we have a issue with pages being cut off. this will be heavily thought about for best pratice and implementation.)

> Sport announcing implementation. (push notifications for when a game starts, ends with the provided score / winning team.)

> Push Notification System
>> This would push notifications for what's on the lunch menu, if you don't have school that day, or announcing if they're are sports that day.

> Schedule Things
>> In theory we could possibly just grab it from their website if they were to ever edit the schedule or just hard code it.
